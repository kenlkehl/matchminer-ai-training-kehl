SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "I'm a medical oncologist and data scientist. Your job is to help me create synthetic clinical data "
    "for cancer research. Realism is CRITICAL. Use all your oncology and biology knowledge to strive for accuracy."
)


DIAGNOSIS_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    'Diagnosis events should include TNM stage, summary stage, primary site/cancer type, and histology. Include key data elements relevant for workup or treatment of that type of cancer, as long as your data elements are compatible with the clinical context provided.\n'
    'Use clinical staging (cTNM) unless the primary tumor was surgically resected; give pathologic staging '
    '(pTNM, or ypTNM after neoadjuvant therapy) only for a resected primary. Patients with distant metastases '
    'at diagnosis usually do not have the primary resected; include that only when it is standard for the '
    'cancer and situation, such as cytoreductive nephrectomy or resection of limited colorectal liver metastases.\n'
)


DIVERSITY_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    'To ensure diversity in the generated data, vary patient age, gender (if it is a cancer type that occurs in both sexes), name, stage at diagnosis, biomarkers, '
    'treatment approaches, and disease course (e.g., stable disease, progression, remission, recurrence). However, this variation must remain within the bounds of the clinical context provided, and it MUST remain clinically realistic. All anatomy must be accurate, any therapy only given for a certain known biomarker in real life must also only be given for that known biomarker in synthetic data, and so on.\n'
)


CONSISTENCY_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    'VERY IMPORTANT: All events MUST be in chronological order and must be internally consistent in that context. '
    'For example, an event from a younger age must not follow an event from an older age, and an organ that has '
    'been removed must not later be described as present.\n'
    'For patients who have surgical resection for their cancer diagnosis, the diagnosis event line item should follow the resection event.\n'
    'CRITICAL: Do not add findings, including claims that disease is absent, for organs that would not have been '
    'visualized by the specified scan type and field of view; for example, a CT of the chest, abdomen, and '
    'pelvis cannot establish the presence or absence of brain metastases.\n'
    'CRITICAL: Do not mention screening or enrollment on the trial itself anywhere in your chronology!! That would '
    'contaminate the synthetic data and render them useless, since we will be using the synthetic data to derive '
    'clinical history models to match patients to clinical trials on which they have not yet enrolled!\n'
)


ELIGIBILITY_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    'Apply all supplied cohort-specific and common eligibility criteria together. Shared criteria can be '
    'inclusion or exclusion requirements; do not interpret them all as exclusions. '
    'For a single cohort, the supplied text is the trial\'s original eligibility criteria. '
    'Prior-treatment and biomarker requirements may each include both positive and '
    'negative conditions. Preserve each clause, its negation, AND/OR logic, and exceptions when interpreting '
    'eligibility.\n'
)


EVENT_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    'Use everything you know about cancer and clinical oncology.\n'
    'Types of events might include a diagnosis as recorded in a cancer registry; initiation of a systemic therapy; '
    'a surgery; a radiation treatment; an adverse event; a clinical progress note; an imaging report; a pathology '
    'report; and a next-generation sequencing (NGS) report. For progress notes, imaging reports, pathology '
    'reports, and NGS reports, include findings documented in the report in the description of the event. \n'
    'NGS reports should be very detailed; they should include both any key actionable alterations if present, and '
    'comutations/fusions/copy number alterations; most reports should describe alterations in many genes, even '
    'though only some of those will be clinically relevant. \n'
    'CRITICAL: Genomic findings should be realistic based on known mutation and comutation patterns. For example, '
    'remember that EGFR mutant lung cancers almost never have KRAS co-mutations. \n'
    'There should be one event per line of text in your output, and each event should be formatted as a sentence. \n'
    'Most patients will have many events along their disease trajectories (often 20-30), but never '
    'extend a history past its final clinical state to add events. \n'
    'Tag each event with an event type at the beginning of the line. Acceptable event types include '
    '<demographics>, <diagnosis>, <systemic>, <surgery>, <radiation>, <adverse_event>, <clinical_note>, '
    '<imaging_report>, <pathology_report>, and <ngs_report>.\n'
    'Each event should correspond only to one point in time, and each report should correspond only to one report '
    'that could have been written at that time.\n'

        'Imaging report events must describe only one radiographic study and should specify the type of study. Imaging '
        'report events must also indicate whether cancer was present on the scan; if so, whether it was responding, '
        'progressing, or neither; and what metastatic sites were involved.\n'
        'Oncologist note events must indicate whether cancer was present at the time; and if so, whether it was '

        '<imaging_report> At age 70 years and 8 weeks, a brain MRI showed the right basal ganglia lesion had decreased to 8 mm with less surrounding edema, consistent with partial response and no new intracranial lesions.\n'
        '<clinical_note> At age 70 years and 8 weeks, the oncologist documented residual CNS lymphoma responding to treatment and improvement in left-sided weakness.\n'
        '<adverse_event> At age 70 years and 9 weeks, the patient developed transient grade 1 nausea during chemotherapy.\n'
        '<imaging_report> At age 70 years and 12 weeks, a brain MRI showed a residual 4 mm enhancing right basal ganglia lesion, continued response, and no new intracranial lesions.\n'
        '<clinical_note> At age 70 years and 12 weeks, the oncologist documented continued response with residual CNS lymphoma.\n'
        '<imaging_report> At age 70 years and 20 weeks, a brain MRI showed no residual enhancing lymphoma in the brain.\n'
        '<clinical_note> At age 70 years and 20 weeks, the oncologist documented a complete radiographic response and resolution of the left-sided weakness.\n'
        '<imaging_report> At age 71 years and 4 weeks, a surveillance brain MRI showed no recurrent intracranial lymphoma.\n'
