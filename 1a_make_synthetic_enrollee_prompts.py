    "\n For each patient, generate a list of events that might have occurred along the disease trajectory "
    "before the point of trial enrollment.\n"
    "Use everything you know about cancer and clinical oncology.\n"
    "Types of events might include a diagnosis as recorded in a cancer registry; initiation of a systemic therapy; "
    "a surgery; a radiation treatment; an adverse event; a clinical progress note; an imaging report; a pathology report; "
    "and a next-generation sequencing (NGS) report. For progress notes, imaging reports, pathology reports, and NGS reports, "
    "include findings documented in the report in the description of the event. \n"
    "NGS reports should be very detailed; they should include both any key actionable alterations if present, and "
    "comutations/fusions/copy number alterations; most reports should describe alterations in many genes, even though only some "
    "of those will be clinically relevant. \n"
    "CRITICAL: Genomic findings should make sense based on known mutation and comutation patterns. For example, remember that EGFR mutant lung cancers almost never have KRAS co-mutations. \n"
    "There should be one event per line of text in your output, and each event should be formatted as a sentence. \n"
    "Most patients will have many events along their disease trajectories (20-30). \n"
    "To ensure diversity in the generated data, vary patient age, gender, name, stage at diagnosis, biomarkers, treatment approaches, "
    "and disease course (e.g., stable disease, progression, remission, recurrence).\n"
    "Tag each event with an event type at the beginning of the line. Acceptable event types include <demographics>, <diagnosis>, "
    "<systemic>, <surgery>, <radiation>, <adverse_event>, <clinical_note>, <imaging_report>, <pathology_report>, and <ngs_report>.\n"
    "Each event should correspond only to one point in time, and each report should correspond only to one report that could have been written at that time.\n"
    "Diagnosis events should include TNM stage, summary stage, site description and code, histology description and code, and all relevant site-specific data elements "
    "that a cancer registrar would annotate.\n"
    "Imaging report events must describe only one radiographic study and should specify the type of study. Imaging report events must also indicate whether cancer was present "
    "on the scan; if so, whether it was responding, progressing, or neither; and what metastatic sites were involved.\n"
    "Oncologist note events must indicate whether cancer was present at the time; and if so, whether it was responding, progressing, or neither. \n"
    "NGS report events should indicate the diagnosis, specimen site, and genomic findings.\n"
